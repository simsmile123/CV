# Computer Vision 2022-2023

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I delved into the fascinating world of visual perception using C++ as the primary programming language. <br> 
Under the guidance of an exceptional teacher, Mr. Jurj, the course provided a comprehensive exploration of computer vision concepts, equipping me with the skills to tackle real-world challenges in image and video understanding. <br> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From fundamental principles to practical applications, the class offered a dynamic and engaging learning experience, solidifying my proficiency in C++ and OpenCV for crafting innovative solutions in the field of computer vision. The labs built upon each other starting from simply creating a line to detecting coins. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the second semester, we extensively utilized OpenCV, a powerful open-source computer vision library, to implement various image processing and analysis techniques.
